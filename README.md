# TheShoeParlor

This repository contains a small React + TypeScript landing page scaffold for an e-commerce site called The Shoe Parlor.

Quick start
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Files of interest:
- `src/` – application source
- `src/components` – landing page components (Header, Hero, ProductGrid, ProductCard, Footer)
- `src/styles/global.css` – basic styles

New pages:
- `src/pages/Featured.tsx` – featured collection page
- `src/pages/About.tsx` – about page
- `src/pages/OurStory.tsx` – our story timeline
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx` – contact form

Want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server here? I can, but it will install packages in your container.
TheShoeParlor is a full-stack e-commerce shoe store built with React and Spring Boot. It allows users to browse shoes by category, create an account, log in and explore products through a clean and modern interface.
